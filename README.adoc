== Regular night in London

He was wandering very late in shadows of the night.
When suddenly out of nowhere he heard a loud *BANG* noise followed by a scream.
He then jump out of the street to hide in an alley and looked where he tought the noise came from.

"Give me all you have," the man yells at her as she bleeds to death. She begs for mercy but he won't listen.
"Give me everything I tell you!" she took one last look in despair and then she lay down. "Give me everything 
I tell you!" she took one last look in despair and then, she stopped breathing. The man watched her die and then, 
in a rage, he tore her bag off and ran away.
